## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed by visiting the [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) page and obtaining the embeddable package. When running `main.pyc`, ensure that it is executed by the `python.exe` file.

## Correct Files
CustomCMD is made up of 3 files, and one extra edition and it can be challenging to find the correct files.

1. **Main.py/pyc**
    This file is the main file, and it should be the file that is executed to start the program

2. **CustomCommands.py/pyc**
    This file is where the Custom Command and Scripting API are stored.  It should not be executed directly as that might cause errors or unexpected behavior.

3. **ConfigManager.py/pyc**
    This file is where the Configuration system is stored.  Similarly to the CustomCommands.py/pyc file it should not be executed directly.

4. **lite.py/pyc**
    If you downloaded CustomCMD lite, then this is the file you should execute.  It is an extremely lightweight version of CustomCMD and runs fast.

## Configuration System
Customize your CustomCMD experience with the configuration system. Version 1.0 introduced the ability to modify various settings. For detailed information, refer to [CONFIG-SYSTEM.md](CONFIG-SYSTEM.md).

## Scripting API
Take customization to the next level with the CustomCMD scripting API. Designed for developers, it offers different functions and classes to seamlessly integrate your programs into CustomCMD. The installation process is straightforward.

Explore the API details in [API-DOCS.md](API-DOCS.md).
