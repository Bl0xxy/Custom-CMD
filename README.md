## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed by visiting the [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) page and obtaining the embeddable package. When running `main.pyc`, ensure that it is executed by the `python.exe` file.

## Correct Files
There are 4 main files to launch CustomCMD at this time.  The first one is main.pyc which is the full version that contains all the features, second one is lite.pyc which is a super lightweight and fast version of CustomCMD that was made in only 4 lines of code, scripting.pyc is a less bloated version of main.pyc which only excludes the configuration system, and configs.pyc is an even less bloated version of main.pyc that only includes the configuration system and base. and no scripting API

## Configuration System
Customize your CustomCMD experience with the configuration system. Version 1.0 introduced the ability to modify various settings. For detailed information, refer to [CONFIG-SYSTEM.md](CONFIG-SYSTEM.md).

## Scripting API
Take customization to the next level with the CustomCMD scripting API. Designed for developers, it offers different functions and classes to seamlessly integrate your programs into CustomCMD. The installation process is straightforward.

Explore the API details in [API-DOCS.md](API-DOCS.md).
