# Read Me
If you want to add custom commands, then please use the custom_commands.json file.  That will not be modified in automatic updates and will always stay compatible.  If you modify the builtins.json file, expect issues to occur.

## Custom Commands
- Credits | Credit The Creators
- Start | Startup Text And Cleared Screen
- Aristotle | No More Aristotle

## Installation
To get Python working, go to [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) and get the embeddable package.  Then when running main.pyc make sure to have it run with your python.exe file in the folder.

## Coming Soon
- Auto Updater via GitHub
- Additional Supported Libraries (Only Suggested Ones)
- Whatever Suggested
- Scripting API
